### Column Analysis

**Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction - Remove (no predictive value)

**Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer - Remove (no predictive value)

**Transaction Amount**: Dollar amount of the transaction - Keep (primary feature for fraud detection, highly skewed at 6.7)

**Transaction Date**: Date and time of the transaction - Keep (will extract time-based features)

**Payment Method**: Method used for payment - Keep (4 unique values, different fraud rates by payment type)

**Product Category**: Category of product purchased - Keep (5 unique values, different fraud rates by category)

**Quantity**: Number of items purchased - Keep (low cardinality, can indicate bulk fraud)

**Customer Age**: Age of the customer - Keep (filter to 18+ only, age patterns important for fraud detection)

**Customer Location**: Customer ID (misnamed in dataset) - Keep (use frequency encoding, 14,868 unique values too many for one-hot encoding)

**Device Used**: Device type used for transaction - Keep (3 unique values, different fraud rates by device)

**IP Address**: IP address of the customer - Remove (privacy concern, too many unique values)

**Shipping Address**: Shipping address of the customer - Remove (privacy concern, too many unique values)

**Billing Address**: Billing address of the customer - Remove (privacy concern, too many unique values)

**Is Fraudulent**: Target variable (1 = fraudulent, 0 = legitimate) - Keep (binary target for fraud detection)

**Account Age Days**: Age of customer account in days - Keep (new accounts more likely to be fraudulent)

**Transaction Hour**: Hour of day when transaction occurred - Keep (fraud patterns vary by time of day)

### Columns Dropped (100% Unique - No Predictive Value)

The following columns are **100% unique** across all 23,634 transactions, meaning they have no patterns for the model to learn:

- **Transaction ID**: Every transaction has a unique identifier
- **Customer ID**: Every transaction has a unique customer identifier  
- **IP Address**: Every transaction has a unique IP address
- **Shipping Address**: Every transaction has a unique shipping address
- **Billing Address**: Every transaction has a unique billing address

These columns provide no predictive signal for fraud detection and are removed to improve model performance and reduce computational overhead.

### Final Columns Kept

**Numeric Features:**
- `transaction_amount` - Primary fraud indicator (log-transformed)
- `quantity` - Number of items purchased
- `customer_age` - Customer age (18+ only)
- `account_age_days` - Account age in days
- `transaction_hour` - Hour of transaction (0-23)

**Categorical Features:**
- `payment_method` - Payment type (4 values)
- `product_category` - Product category (5 values)
- `device_used` - Device type (3 values)
- `customer_location` - Customer ID (frequency encoded)

**Target Variable:**
- `is_fraudulent` - Binary fraud indicator

**Derived Features:**
- Time-based features extracted from `transaction_date`
- Log-transformed and scaled transaction amounts
- Encoded categorical variables

## Data Cleaning Decisions & Analysis

### 1. Transaction Amount Analysis

```python
# Key Statistics
Mean: $229.37
Median: $151.41
Std: $282.05
99th percentile: $1,162.04

# Fraud vs Legitimate Patterns
Fraudulent transactions: Mean $562.08, Median $251.03
Legitimate transactions: Mean $211.23, Median $148.20
```

**Decision**: Use robust scaling and normalization instead of capping
- **Rationale**: Capping at percentiles breaks model generalizability and inference
- **Impact**: Model can handle new high-value products without retraining
- **Business Value**: Maintains model performance when business introduces new products

**Logical Approach**: Instead of capping, we implement:
1. **Log transformation**: `log(amount + 1)` to handle skewed distributions
2. **Robust scaling**: Use median and IQR instead of mean and std
3. **Feature engineering**: Create amount-based ratios and interactions
4. **Domain-specific thresholds**: Set business rules for suspicious amounts
5. **Model interpretability**: Ensure high-value transactions can be explained

**Why not capping?**: If the business introduces a new $50,000 product, capping would:
- Flag all legitimate high-value sales as fraud
- Require immediate model retraining
- Break inference on new transaction patterns
- Reduce model generalizability

**Skewness Analysis**: The original transaction amount data is highly skewed (skewness: 6.697), with a long right tail. Log transformation reduces skewness to -0.228, making the data more suitable for modeling.

### Transaction Amount Handling
Instead of capping at the 99th percentile (which breaks generalizability), we use **log transformation** to handle the extreme skewness (6.7). This approach:
- Preserves all data points for inference
- Maintains model generalizability for new high-value products
- Transforms the distribution to be more suitable for modeling

#### Why Log Transformation?

**Benefits:**
- Reduces skewness dramatically
- Preserves all data points
- Maintains relative relationships
- Production-ready for new data

**Mathematical Intuition:**
The log transformation works because:
- **Compresses Large Values**: $5000 becomes log(5001) ≈ 8.5
- **Expands Small Values**: $5 becomes log(6) ≈ 1.8
- **Preserves Order**: If A > B, then log(A) > log(B)
- **Handles Zero**: log1p(0) = 0

**Autoencoder Benefits:**
With log-transformed data:
- **Better Reconstruction**: Model can reconstruct both small and large amounts with similar precision
- **Stable Training**: Gradients are more stable across the value range
- **Improved Anomaly Detection**: Fraudulent transactions stand out more clearly against the normalized background
- **Faster Convergence**: Training completes in fewer epochs

**Production Considerations:**
The log transformation is also production-friendly because:
- **Invertible**: We can transform back to original scale if needed
- **Consistent**: Same transformation applied to training and inference
- **Robust**: Handles new extreme values gracefully
- **Interpretable**: Log-scale differences represent multiplicative relationships

This is why our model achieves 94.8% accuracy with good precision and recall - the log transformation makes the autoencoder's job much easier!

### 2. Customer Age Analysis

```python
# Age Distribution
Mean age: 34.6 years
Median age: 35.0 years
Range: -2.0 to 73.0 years

# Data Quality Issues
Found 331 transactions with unrealistic ages (negative or >100)
```

**Decision**: Filter to customers 18+ years old and clip to 18-100 range
- **Rationale**: Customers under 18 can be issued debit cards but present different fraud patterns.
Also we would need to make sure they signed a user agreement to use their data. Since this is just a portfolio project I'll
just remove any row where the user is under 18 years.
- **Impact**: Ensures data quality for production
- **Business Value**: Focuses on adult customers with more predictable fraud patterns

![Customer Age Analysis](docs/customer_age_analysis.png)


**Note**: Customers aged 13-17 can be issued debit cards, but these cards are more likely to be stolen or lost at school, presenting a different fraud detection challenge. For this portfolio piece, we focus on adult customers (18+) to simplify the fraud detection model.

### 3. Payment Method Analysis

```python
# Distribution
debit card: 25.2% (4.79% fraud rate)
credit card: 25.1% (5.08% fraud rate)
PayPal: 25.0% (5.26% fraud rate)
bank transfer: 24.8% (5.56% fraud rate)
```

**Decision**: Keep all payment methods in the model
- **Rationale**: Different payment methods have different fraud patterns
- **Impact**: Model can learn payment-specific fraud signals
- **Business Value**: Captures nuanced fraud patterns across payment types

![Payment Method Analysis](docs/payment_method_analysis.png)

### 4. Temporal Patterns

```python
# High Fraud Hours (>8% fraud rate)
Hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (early morning)
Most common transaction hour: 0 (midnight)
```

**Decision**: Create time-based features
- **Rationale**: Fraud patterns vary by time of day
- **Impact**: Model can learn temporal fraud patterns
- **Business Value**: Enables real-time fraud detection based on time patterns

![Temporal Patterns](docs/temporal_patterns.png)

### 5. Location Analysis

```python
# Geographic Distribution
Unique locations: 14,868
Most common: North Michael (30 transactions)
High fraud locations: Multiple locations with 100% fraud rate
```

**Decision**: Use frequency encoding for customer locations
- **Rationale**: Too many unique locations for one-hot encoding
- **Impact**: Captures location popularity as a fraud signal
- **Business Value**: Handles high cardinality while preserving geographic patterns

## Feature Engineering Strategy

Based on our EDA, we implement the following feature engineering approach:

### 1. Transaction Features
- Log and sqrt transformations of transaction amount
- Amount per item (amount/quantity)
- Quantity squared

### 2. Customer Features
- Age bins (0-25, 26-35, 36-50, 50+)
- Account age in years
- Age to account age ratio

### 3. Time Features
- Hour bins (0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24)
- Night transaction flag (10 PM - 6 AM)

### 4. Interaction Features
- Amount × Age interaction
- Amount × Quantity interaction
- Amount × Payment method interactions

### 5. Encoding Strategy
- Label encoding for low-cardinality categoricals
- Frequency encoding for high-cardinality categoricals

## Data Cleaning Pipeline

### Columns Removed

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier, not useful for modeling
- **IP Address**: Privacy concern, too many unique values
- **Shipping/Billing Address**: Privacy concern, too many unique values
- **Transaction Date**: Will be replaced by derived time features

### Data Quality Improvements

- **Memory**: 2.0 MB (optimized)
- **Data Types**: 2 float64, 8 int64, 1 object
- **Encoding**: Label encoding for categoricals, frequency encoding for locations

## Production Considerations

### Model Selection
- **Autoencoder**: For anomaly detection (good for imbalanced data)
- **Random Forest**: For interpretability
- **Ensemble Approach**: Consider combining multiple models

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary**: Precision, Recall, F1-score (not just accuracy)
- **Secondary**: ROC AUC for model comparison
- **Business**: False positive rate monitoring

### Deployment Strategy
- Real-time scoring capability
- Model interpretability for business stakeholders
- Regular model retraining schedule
