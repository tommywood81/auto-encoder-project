# E-commerce Fraud Detection with Autoencoders

> **Can we catch fraudsters using only normal transaction patterns?** 

This project explores how autoencoders can detect fraudulent e-commerce transactions by learning what "normal" looks like. Instead of trying to identify fraud directly, we teach the model to recognize legitimate patterns‚Äîanything that doesn't fit becomes a potential red flag.

**Current Performance**: Our best model achieves an **AUC ROC of 0.6511** using a combination of behavioral, temporal, and demographic features.

Create tests in `tests/test_feature_engineering.py`:

```python
def test_your_new_strategy():
    """Test your new feature engineering strategy."""
    # Create test data
    df = create_test_data()
    
    # Create strategy
    strategy = YourNewStrategy()
    
    # Generate features
    features = strategy.generate_features(df)
    
    # Assertions
    assert 'your_custom_feature' in features.columns
    assert 'another_feature' in features.columns
    assert len(features) == len(df)
    
    # Test feature info
    info = strategy.get_feature_info()
    assert info['strategy'] == 'your_new_strategy'
    assert info['feature_count'] > 0
```

#### **Step 5: Update Documentation**

Add your strategy to the README feature engineering section:

```markdown
#### **Your New Strategy** (12 features)
**Fraud Detection Logic**: Explain how your strategy catches fraud.

- **Feature 1**: Description of how this catches fraud
- **Feature 2**: Description of how this catches fraud
- **Feature 3**: Description of how this catches fraud
```

### üîç **Required Modules to Modify**

| Module | Purpose | What to Change |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `src/feature_factory/strategies.py` | Strategy implementation | Add your new strategy class |
| `src/feature_factory/feature_factory.py` | Strategy factory | Import, descriptions, and registry |
| `src/config.py` | Configuration management | Add strategy-specific config (optional) |
| `tests/test_feature_engineering.py` | Testing | Add unit tests for your strategy |
| `README.md` | Documentation | Add strategy description and logic |

### üìù **Best Practices**

#### **1. Strategy Design**
- **Inherit from FeatureEngineer**: Ensures consistency with existing strategies
- **Start with baseline features**: Most strategies build on the foundation
- **Use meaningful feature names**: Make it clear what each feature represents
- **Add comprehensive logging**: Help with debugging and monitoring

#### **2. Feature Engineering**
- **Focus on fraud detection**: Every feature should have a clear fraud detection purpose
- **Avoid data leakage**: Don't use future information or target variables
- **Handle missing values**: Ensure your strategy works with incomplete data
- **Scale appropriately**: Consider the computational cost of your features

#### **3. Testing**
- **Unit tests**: Test individual feature generation
- **Integration tests**: Test with the full pipeline
- **Performance tests**: Ensure your strategy doesn't break performance requirements
- **Edge cases**: Test with unusual data scenarios

#### **4. Documentation**
- **Clear descriptions**: Explain the fraud detection logic
- **Feature explanations**: Document what each feature captures
- **Usage examples**: Show how to use your strategy
- **Performance notes**: Document expected performance characteristics

### üöÄ **Example: Adding a "Seasonal Features" Strategy**

Here's a complete example of adding a seasonal features strategy:

#### **1. Strategy Implementation**
```python
class SeasonalFeatures(FeatureEngineer):
    """Seasonal pattern features for fraud detection."""
    
    def generate_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Generate seasonal features."""
        logger.info("Generating seasonal features...")
        
        # Start with baseline features
        baseline = BaselineFeatures()
        features = baseline.generate_features(df)
        
        # Extract date components
        df['transaction_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_date'])
        features['day_of_week'] = df['transaction_date'].dt.dayofweek
        features['month'] = df['transaction_date'].dt.month
        features['quarter'] = df['transaction_date'].dt.quarter
        
        # Seasonal patterns
        features['is_weekend'] = (features['day_of_week'] >= 5).astype(int)
        features['is_month_start'] = (df['transaction_date'].dt.day <= 3).astype(int)
        features['is_month_end'] = (df['transaction_date'].dt.day >= 28).astype(int)
        
        # Holiday season (example: December)
        features['is_holiday_season'] = (features['month'] == 12).astype(int)
        
        # Seasonal risk score
        features['seasonal_risk_score'] = (
            features['is_weekend'] * 0.2 +
            features['is_month_start'] * 0.3 +
            features['is_month_end'] * 0.3 +
            features['is_holiday_season'] * 0.2
        )
        
        logger.info(f"Seasonal features generated: {len(features.columns)} features")
        return features
    
    def get_feature_info(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            'strategy': 'seasonal',
            'feature_count': 15,
            'description': 'Seasonal and temporal pattern features for fraud detection'
        }
```

#### **2. Factory Updates**
```python
# In feature_factory.py
from .strategies import (
    # ... existing imports ...
    SeasonalFeatures
)

STRATEGY_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    # ... existing strategies ...
    "seasonal": "Seasonal and temporal pattern features for fraud detection"
}

strategies = {
    # ... existing strategies ...
    "seasonal": SeasonalFeatures
}
```

#### **3. Testing**
```python
def test_seasonal_features():
    """Test seasonal feature engineering strategy."""
    df = create_test_data()
    strategy = SeasonalFeatures()
    features = strategy.generate_features(df)
    
    assert 'day_of_week' in features.columns
    assert 'seasonal_risk_score' in features.columns
    assert features['is_weekend'].isin([0, 1]).all()
```

### üîß **Advanced Customization**

#### **Custom Base Classes**
If your strategy is significantly different, you can create a custom base class:

```python
class AdvancedFeatureEngineer(FeatureEngineer):
    """Advanced feature engineer with additional capabilities."""
    
    def __init__(self, custom_param: float = 0.5):
        self.custom_param = custom_param
    
    def preprocess_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Custom preprocessing step."""
        return df
    
    def postprocess_features(self, features: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Custom postprocessing step."""
        return features
```

#### **Configuration-Driven Features**
Make your strategy configurable:

```python
class ConfigurableFeatures(FeatureEngineer):
    """Configurable feature engineering strategy."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: FeatureConfig):
        self.config = config
    
    def generate_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        features = super().generate_features(df)
        
        if self.config.include_interactions:
            features = self._add_interaction_features(features)
        
        if self.config.include_polynomials:
            features = self._add_polynomial_features(features)
        
        return features
```

### üìä **Validation Checklist**

Before submitting your new strategy, ensure:

- [ ] **Strategy class inherits from FeatureEngineer**
- [ ] **All required methods implemented** (generate_features, get_feature_info)
- [ ] **Added to feature factory** (import, descriptions, registry)
- [ ] **Unit tests written and passing**
- [ ] **Documentation updated** (README, docstrings)
- [ ] **No data leakage** (doesn't use future information)
- [ ] **Handles edge cases** (missing values, unusual data)
- [ ] **Performance acceptable** (doesn't break pipeline performance)
- [ ] **Fraud detection logic clear** (explains how it catches fraud)

### üéØ **Getting Help**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check existing strategies**: Look at similar strategies for examples
2. **Review tests**: See how other strategies are tested
3. **Check logs**: Use the comprehensive logging to debug issues
4. **Validate data**: Ensure your features work with the actual data format
5. **Performance profile**: Monitor the impact on pipeline performance

This modular approach makes it easy to experiment with new fraud detection techniques while maintaining system stability and performance.

## Architecture

### System Overview

The project follows a modular, production-ready architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py          # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/              # Data cleaning and processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_factory/   # Strategy pattern for feature engineering
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/            # Autoencoder implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ evaluation/        # Model evaluation and metrics
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Feature engineering strategies
2. **Factory Pattern**: Configuration and feature strategy creation
3. **Pipeline Pattern**: Sequential data processing steps
4. **Configuration Pattern**: Centralized settings management
5. **Observer Pattern**: Logging and monitoring throughout pipeline

### Configuration Management

The heart of the system is a sophisticated configuration system that manages everything from data paths to model hyperparameters:

```python
@dataclass
class PipelineConfig:
    """Main pipeline configuration."""
    name: str
    description: str
    feature_strategy: str
    data: DataConfig
    model: ModelConfig
    features: FeatureConfig
    
    @classmethod
    def get_config(cls, strategy: str) -> 'PipelineConfig':
        """Get configuration by strategy name."""
        if strategy == "baseline":
            return cls.get_baseline_config()
        elif strategy == "temporal":
            return cls.get_temporal_config()
        elif strategy == "behavioural":
            return cls.get_behavioural_config()
        elif strategy == "demographic_risk":
            return cls.get_demographic_risk_config()
        elif strategy == "combined":
            return cls.get_combined_config()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown strategy: {strategy}")
```

**Why This Design?** I wanted to make experiments reproducible and configurable. Each strategy has its own factory method, making it easy to version-control different experimental setups.

### Feature Factory Pattern

The feature engineering system uses the **Strategy Pattern** to make it easy to experiment with different feature combinations:

```python
class FeatureEngineer(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for feature engineering strategies."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_features(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Generate features for the given dataset."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_feature_info(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get information about the features generated."""
        pass


class FeatureFactory:
    """Factory for creating feature engineering strategies."""
    
    STRATEGY_CLASSES = {
        "baseline": BaselineFeatures,
        "temporal": TemporalFeatures,
        "behavioural": BehaviouralFeatures,
        "demographic_risk": DemographicRiskFeatures,
        "combined": CombinedFeatures
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, strategy_name: str) -> FeatureEngineer:
        """Create a feature engineering strategy."""
        return cls.STRATEGY_CLASSES[strategy_name]()
```

**Why This Pattern?** It makes adding new feature strategies trivial. Want to test a new behavioral feature? Just implement the interface and add it to the factory.

### Pipeline Workflow

The main pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`) orchestrates the entire fraud detection workflow:

```python
def run_pipeline(strategy: str):
    """Run the complete fraud detection pipeline with given strategy."""
    
    # 1. Load configuration
    config = PipelineConfig.get_config(strategy)
    
    # 2. Data cleaning
    cleaner = DataCleaner(config)
    df_cleaned = cleaner.clean_data(save_output=True)
    
    # 3. Feature engineering
    feature_engineer = FeatureFactory.create(config.feature_strategy)
    df_features = feature_engineer.generate_features(df_cleaned)
    
    # 4. Model training
    autoencoder = BaselineAutoencoder(config)
    results = autoencoder.train()
    
    return results
```

Each step is isolated and can be tested independently, making the system robust and maintainable.

## Results

### Dataset Overview

We're working with **23,634 e-commerce transactions** where about 5.17% are fraudulent (1,222 fraudulent vs 22,412 legitimate). This imbalance makes it a perfect candidate for anomaly detection.

![Dataset Summary](./docs/dataset_summary.png)

### Data Quality Decisions

#### Customer Age Filtering
**The Problem**: Some customers had unrealistic ages (like 5-year-olds making purchases).
**The Decision**: Filtered to customers 18+ years old.
**Legal Reasoning**: Users under 18 cannot legally agree to user agreements and terms of service, making their transactions potentially invalid from a legal standpoint.
**Impact**: Focused on adult customers with predictable fraud patterns, removing 1,054 unrealistic transactions. For now, we're dropping under-18 users and will consult with management on how they want to handle this demographic.

![Customer Age Analysis](./docs/customer_age_analysis.png)

#### Transaction Amount Handling
**The Problem**: Transaction amounts were heavily skewed (skewness of 6.7).
**The Decision**: Used log transformation instead of capping.
**Why It Worked**: Capping would break generalizability for new high-value products. Log transformation reduced skewness to -0.228 while preserving the ability to handle new products.

![Transaction Amount Analysis](./docs/transaction_amount_analysis.png)
![Transaction Amount Skewness](./docs/transaction_amount_skewness_analysis.png)

#### Feature Selection Strategy
**The Problem**: Some columns looked useful but were actually noise.
**The Decision**: Removed 5 columns (Transaction ID, Customer ID, IP Address, Shipping/Billing Address) because they contained all unique values.
**Why It Worked**: Reduced noise and improved model convergence.

![Missing Values Analysis](./docs/missing_values.png)

### Feature Sweep Performance

Our systematic testing revealed that combining all feature strategies provides the best performance:

| Strategy | ROC AUC | Improvement | What It Tests |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Combined** | **0.6511** | **+9.36%** | All features together |
| Behavioural | 0.6235 | +4.72% | Purchase behavior patterns |
| Demographic Risk | 0.6164 | +3.52% | Age-based risk scoring |
| Temporal | 0.6119 | +2.77% | Time-based patterns |
| Baseline | 0.5954 | - | Core transaction features |

### Model Performance Visualization

![ROC Curve](./docs/roc_curve.png)
![PR Curve](./docs/pr_curve.png)
![Confusion Matrix](./docs/confusion_matrix.png)

### Key Insights

The results show that:
1. **More features help**: The combined strategy outperforms individual strategies
2. **Behavioral patterns matter**: Amount per item is a strong fraud indicator
3. **Time matters**: Night-time transactions are indeed suspicious
4. **Age matters**: Younger customers show higher fraud risk

### Performance Metrics

- **Best Strategy**: Combined features (ROC AUC: 0.6511)
- **Improvement over Baseline**: +9.36%
- **Training Time**: ~1 minute per strategy
- **Total Features**: 12 unique features

### Temporal Patterns
